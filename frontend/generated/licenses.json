If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright 2019 Google LLC\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/."

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

    "licenseText": "# `@nuxt/babel-preset-app`\n\n> Default babel preset for nuxt\n\n## Usage\n\nThis is the default preset used by Nuxt, which is mainly a wrapper around the `@babel/preset-env` preset. It also optionally uses the `@vue/babel-preset-jsx` preset as well as `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators`, `@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties`, `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`. Furthermore the preset is adding polyfills.\n\n**Note**: Since `core-js@2` and `core-js@3` are both supported from Babel 7.4.0, we recommend directly adding `core-js` and setting the version via the [`corejs`](#corejs) option.\n\n```sh\nyarn add --dev core-js@3 @babel/runtime-corejs3\n\n# or\n\nyarn add --dev core-js@2 @babel/runtime-corejs2\n\n```\n\nUsually, no additional configuration is required. If needed though, there is an option to fine-tune the preset's behavior. Just add the following to `nuxt.config.js`:\n\n```js\nbabel: {\n  presets(env, [ preset, options ]) {\n    return [\n      [ \"@nuxt/babel-preset-app\", options ]\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`env` is an object which contains `envName` (`server`, `client`, `modern`) and all `nuxtEnv` properties (`isDev`, `isServer`, `isClient`, `isModern`, `isLegacy`)\n\n`preset` is the preset package name `@nuxt/babel-preset-app`\n\n`options` is an object with parameters, for example:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  useBuiltIns: \"entry\"\n}\n```\n\nBelow is a list of all available `options` parameters:\n\n### Options\n\n* **bugfixes** - [`@babel/preset-env`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#bugfixes)\n* **configPath** - [`@babel/preset-env` parameter](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#configpath)\n* **forceAllTransforms** - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#forcealltransforms)' parameter\n* **debug**, default  `false` - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#debug)' parameter\n* **decoratorsBeforeExport**\n* **decoratorsLegacy**, default true\n* **exclude** - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#exclude)' parameter\n* **ignoreBrowserslistConfig**, defaults to value of `modern` - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#ignorebrowserslistconfig)' parameter\n* **include** - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#include)' parameter\n* **jsx**, default true, can be a an object passed as params to [@vue/babel-preset-jsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vue/babel-preset-jsx)\n* **loose**, default `false` - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#loose)' parameter and also sets `loose=true` for `@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties`\n* **modules**, default `false` - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#modules)' parameter\n* **polyfills**, default `core-js@2: ['es6.array.iterator','es6.promise','es6.object.assign','es7.promise.finally']`, `core-js@3: ['es.array.iterator','es.promise','es.object.assign','es.promise.finally']`, more [in the corresponding repository](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js)\n* **shippedProposals** - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#shippedproposals)' parameter\n* **spec** - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#spec)' parameter\n* **targets** - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#targets)' parameter\n* **useBuiltIns**, default `\"usage\"` - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#usebuiltins)' parameter\n* **corejs**, default `{ version: 2 }` - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#corejs)' parameter\n\nThere are [detailed docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#options) for the parameters of '@babel/preset-env'.\n\n### Example 1. Change targets for server and client respectively\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  build: {\n    babel: {\n      presets({ envName }) {\n        const envTargets = {\n          client: { browsers: [\"last 2 versions\"], ie: 11 },\n          server: { node: \"current\" },\n        }\n        return [\n          [\n            \"@nuxt/babel-preset-app\",\n            {\n              targets: envTargets[envName]\n            }\n          ]\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2. Use core-js@3\n\n**NOTE**: Make sure that all dependencies have been upgraded to use core-js@3. If core-js@2 and core-js@3 are both dependent, babel may resolve incorrect core-js package which is hoisted by yarn/npm.\n\n```sh\nyarn add --dev core-js@3 @babel/runtime-corejs3\n```\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  build: {\n    babel: {\n      // envName: server, client, modern\n      presets({ envName }) {\n        return [\n          [\n            '@nuxt/babel-preset-app',\n            {\n              corejs: { version: 3 }\n            }\n          ]\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```"

Reading stack trace of the console slows you down from active development. Instead **Youch** print those errors in structured HTML to the browser.\n\n## Features\n1. HTML reporter\n2. JSON reporter, if request accepts a json instead of text/html.\n3. Sorted frames of error stack.\n\n## Installation\n```bash\nnpm i --save @nuxtjs/youch\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\nYouch is used by [AdonisJs](http://adonisjs.com) and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org), but it can be used by express or raw HTTP server as well.\n\n```javascript\nconst Youch = require('@nuxtjs/youch')\nconst http = require('http')\n\nhttp.createServer(function (req, res) {\n\n  // PERFORM SOME ACTION\n  if (error) {\n    const youch = new Youch(error, req)\n\n    youch\n    .toHTML()\n    .then((html) => {\n      res.writeHead(200, {'content-type': 'text/html'})\n      res.write(html)\n      res.end()\n    })\n  }\n\n}).listen(8000)\n```\n\n## Release History\nCheckout [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file for release history.\n\n## Meta\nCheckout [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) for license information\nHarminder Virk (Aman) - [https://github.com/thetutlage](https://github.com/thetutlage)\n\n\n[appveyor-image]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/nuxt/youch?branch=master&svg=true&passingText=Passing%20On%20Windows\n[appveyor-url]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nuxt/youch\n\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@nuxtjs/youch.svg?style=flat-square\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/@nuxtjs/youch\n\n[travis-image]: https://img.shields.io/travis/nuxt/youch/master.svg?style=flat-square\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/nuxt/youch\n\n[gitter-url]: https://gitter.im/adonisjs/adonis-framework\n[gitter-image]: https://img.shields.io/badge/gitter-join%20us-1DCE73.svg?style=flat-square\n\n[trello-url]: https://trello.com/b/yzpqCgdl/adonis-for-humans\n[trello-image]: https://img.shields.io/badge/trello-roadmap-89609E.svg?style=flat-square\n\n[patreon-url]: https://www.patreon.com/adonisframework\n[patreon-image]: https://img.shields.io/badge/patreon-support%20AdonisJs-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square\n\n[npm-downloads]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@nuxtjs/youch.svg?style=flat-square"

    "licenseText": "## @vue/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx\n\n> Babel plugin for Vue 2.0 JSX\n\n### Babel Compatibility Notes\n\n- This repo is only compatible with Babel 7.x, for 6.x please use [vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx](https://github.com/vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx)\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Assumes you are using Babel with a module bundler e.g. Webpack, because the spread merge helper is imported as a module to avoid duplication.\n\n- This is mutually exclusive with `babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx`.\n\n### Usage\n\n```bash\nnpm install @vue/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx --save-dev\nnpm install @vue/babel-helper-vue-jsx-merge-props --save\n```\n\nIn your `.babelrc`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\"transform-vue-jsx\"]\n}\n```\n\nHowever it is recommended to use the [configurable preset](../babel-preset-jsx/README.md) instead.\n\n### Details\n\nThe plugin transpiles the following JSX:\n\n```jsx\n<div id=\"foo\">{this.text}</div>\n```\n\nTo the following JavaScript:\n\n```js\nh(\n  'div',\n  {\n    attrs: {\n      id: 'foo',\n    },\n  },\n  [this.text],\n)\n```\n\nNote the `h` function, which is a shorthand for a Vue instance's `$createElement` method, must be in the scope where the JSX is. Since this method is passed to component render functions as the first argument, in most cases you'd do this:\n\n```js\nVue.component('jsx-example', {\n  render(h) {\n    // <-- h must be in scope\n    return <div id=\"foo\">bar</div>\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Difference from React JSX\n\nFirst, Vue 2.0's vnode format is different from React's. The second argument to the `createElement` call is a \"data object\" that accepts nested objects. Each nested object will be then processed by corresponding modules:\n\n```js\nrender (h) {\n  return h('div', {\n    // Component props\n    props: {\n      msg: 'hi'\n    },\n    // Normal HTML attributes\n    attrs: {\n      id: 'foo'\n    },\n    // DOM props\n    domProps: {\n      innerHTML: 'bar'\n    },\n    // Event handlers are nested under \"on\", though\n    // modifiers such as in v-on:keyup.enter are not\n    // supported. You'll have to manually check the\n    // keyCode in the handler instead.\n    on: {\n      click: this.clickHandler\n    },\n    // For components only. Allows you to listen to\n    // native events, rather than events emitted from\n    // the component using vm.$emit.\n    nativeOn: {\n      click: this.nativeClickHandler\n    },\n    // Class is a special module, same API as `v-bind:class`\n    class: {\n      foo: true,\n      bar: false\n    },\n    // Style is also same as `v-bind:style`\n    style: {\n      color: 'red',\n      fontSize: '14px'\n    },\n    // Other special top-level properties\n    key: 'key',\n    ref: 'ref',\n    // Assign the `ref` is used on elements/components with v-for\n    refInFor: true,\n    slot: 'slot'\n  })\n}\n```\n\nThe equivalent of the above in Vue 2.0 JSX is:\n\n```jsx\nrender (h) {\n  return (\n    <div\n      // Component props\n      propsMsg=\"hi\"\n      // Normal attributes or component props.\n      id=\"foo\"\n      // DOM properties are prefixed with `domProps`\n      domPropsInnerHTML=\"bar\"\n      // event listeners are prefixed with `on` or `nativeOn`\n      onClick={this.clickHandler}\n      nativeOnClick={this.nativeClickHandler}\n      // other special top-level properties\n      class={{ foo: true, bar: false }}\n      style={{ color: 'red', fontSize: '14px' }}\n      key=\"key\"\n      ref=\"ref\"\n      // assign the `ref` is used on elements/components with v-for\n      refInFor\n      slot=\"slot\">\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Component Tip\n\nIf a custom element starts with lowercase, it will be treated as a string id and used to lookup a registered component. If it starts with uppercase, it will be treated as an identifier, which allows you to do:\n\n```js\nimport Todo from './Todo.js'\n\nexport default {\n  render(h) {\n    return <Todo /> // no need to register Todo via components option\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### JSX Spread\n\nJSX spread is supported, and this plugin will intelligently merge nested data properties. For example:\n\n```jsx\nconst data = {\n  class: ['b', 'c'],\n}\nconst vnode = <div class=\"a\" {...data} />\n```\n\nThe merged data will be:\n\n```js\n{ class: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }\n```\n\n### Vue directives\n\nVue directives are usable the same way as in template with a few key differences:\n\n1.  You can use directives camelCased instead of kebab-cased (vMyDirective is treated as `v-my-directive`)\n2.  You have to use underscore sign instead of dots for modifiers because of JSXIdentifier limitation.\n3.  Only runtime directives work (only v-show and custom directives), compile-time directives are out of this project's scope.\n\nA full example would be: `<MyComponent vMyDirective:argument_modifier1_modifier2={someExpression} />`"

It is used in [vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader) version 15 and above.\n\nThe API surface is intentionally minimal - the goal is to reuse as much as possible while being as flexible as possible.\n\n## Why isn't `vue-template-compiler` a peerDependency?\n\nSince this package is more often used as a low-level utility, it is usually a transitive dependency in an actual Vue project. It is therefore the responsibility of the higher-level package (e.g. `vue-loader`) to inject `vue-template-compiler` via options when calling the `parse` and `compileTemplate` methods.\n\nNot listing it as a peer depedency also allows tooling authors to use a non-default template compiler instead of `vue-template-compiler` without having to include it just to fullfil the peer dep requirement.\n\n## API\n\n### parse(ParseOptions): SFCDescriptor\n\nParse raw single file component source into a descriptor with source maps. The actual compiler (`vue-template-compiler`) must be passed in via the `compiler` option so that the specific version used can be determined by the end user.\n\n``` ts\ninterface ParseOptions {\n  source: string\n  filename?: string\n  compiler: VueTemplateCompiler\n  // https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/packages/vue-template-compiler#compilerparsecomponentfile-options\n  // default: { pad: 'line' }\n  compilerParseOptions?: VueTemplateCompilerParseOptions\n  sourceRoot?: string\n  needMap?: boolean\n}\n\ninterface SFCDescriptor {\n  template: SFCBlock | null\n  script: SFCBlock | null\n  styles: SFCBlock[]\n  customBlocks: SFCCustomBlock[]\n}\n\ninterface SFCCustomBlock {\n  type: string\n  content: string\n  attrs: { [key: string]: string | true }\n  start: number\n  end: number\n  map?: RawSourceMap\n}\n\ninterface SFCBlock extends SFCCustomBlock {\n  lang?: string\n  src?: string\n  scoped?: boolean\n  module?: string | boolean\n}\n```\n\n### compileTemplate(TemplateCompileOptions): TemplateCompileResults\n\nTakes raw template source and compile it into JavaScript code. The actual compiler (`vue-template-compiler`) must be passed in via the `compiler` option so that the specific version used can be determined by the end user.\n\nIt can also optionally perform pre-processing for any templating engine supported by [consolidate](https://github.com/tj/consolidate.js/).\n\n``` ts\ninterface TemplateCompileOptions {\n  source: string\n  filename: string\n\n  compiler: VueTemplateCompiler\n  // https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/packages/vue-template-compiler#compilercompiletemplate-options\n  // default: {}\n  compilerOptions?: VueTemplateCompilerOptions\n\n  // Template preprocessor\n  preprocessLang?: string\n  preprocessOptions?: any\n\n  // Transform asset urls found in the template into `require()` calls\n  // This is off by default. If set to true, the default value is\n  // {\n  //   audio: 'src',\n  //   video: ['src', 'poster'],\n  //   source: 'src',\n  //   img: 'src',\n  //   image: ['xlink:href', 'href'],\n  //   use: ['xlink:href', 'href']\n  // }\n  transformAssetUrls?: AssetURLOptions | boolean\n\n  // For vue-template-es2015-compiler, which is a fork of Buble\n  transpileOptions?: any\n\n  isProduction?: boolean  // default: false\n  isFunctional?: boolean  // default: false\n  optimizeSSR?: boolean   // default: false\n\n  // Whether prettify compiled render function or not (development only)\n  // default: true\n  prettify?: boolean\n}\n\ninterface TemplateCompileResult {\n  ast: Object | undefined\n  code: string\n  source: string\n  tips: string[]\n  errors: string[]\n}\n\ninterface AssetURLOptions {\n  [name: string]: string | string[]\n}\n```\n\n#### Handling the Output\n\nThe resulting JavaScript code will look like this:\n\n``` js\nvar render = function (h) { /* ... */}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function (h) { /* ... */}, function (h) { /* ... */}]\n```\n\nIt **does NOT** assume any module system. It is your responsibility to handle the exports, if needed.\n\n### compileStyle(StyleCompileOptions)\n\nTake input raw CSS and applies scoped CSS transform. It does NOT handle pre-processors. If the component doesn't use scoped CSS then this step can be skipped.\n\n``` ts\ninterface StyleCompileOptions {\n  source: string\n  filename: string\n  id: string\n  map?: any\n  scoped?: boolean\n  trim?: boolean\n  preprocessLang?: string\n  preprocessOptions?: any\n  postcssOptions?: any\n  postcssPlugins?: any[]\n}\n\ninterface StyleCompileResults {\n  code: string\n  map: any | void\n  rawResult: LazyResult | void // raw lazy result from PostCSS\n  errors: string[]\n}\n```\n\n### compileStyleAsync(StyleCompileOptions)\n\nSame as `compileStyle(StyleCompileOptions)` but it returns a Promise resolving to `StyleCompileResults`. It can be used with async postcss plugins."

If You\n   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n   as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n   meet the following conditions:\n\n   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n       stating that You changed the files; and\n\n   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n       the Derivative Works; and\n\n   (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n       as modifying the License.\n\n   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n   the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright {yyyy} {name of copyright owner}\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.\n\n###And why is this a separate module?\n\nI'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem."

JSON does not specify a way to encode binary data, so the Node.js implementation of `JSON.stringify` represents buffers as an object of shape `{ type: \"Buffer\", data: [<bytes as numbers>] }`. Unfortunately, `JSON.parse` does not turn this structure back into a `Buffer` object:\n\n```\n$ node\n> JSON.parse(JSON.stringify({ buf: Buffer.from('hello world') }))\n{ buf:\n   { type: 'Buffer',\n     data: [ 104, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 119, 111, 114, 108, 100 ] } }\n```\n\n`JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` accept arguments called [`replacer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#The_replacer_parameter) and [`reviver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse#Using_the_reviver_parameter) respectively which allow customizing the parsing/encoding behavior. This module provides a replacer which encodes Buffer data as a base64-encoded string, and a reviver which turns JSON objects which contain buffer-like data (either as arrays of numbers or strings) into `Buffer` instances. All other types of values are parsed/encoded as normal.\n\n## API\n\n### `stringify(value[, space])`\n\nConvenience wrapper for [`JSON.stringify`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) with the `replacer` described below.\n\n### `parse(text)`\n\nConvenience wrapper for [`JSON.parse`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) with the `reviver` described below.\n\n### `replacer(key, value)`\n\nA [`replacer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#The_replacer_parameter) implementation which turns every value that is a `Buffer` instance into an object of shape `{ type: 'Buffer', data: 'base64:<base64-encoded buffer content>' }`. Empty buffers are encoded as `{ type: 'Buffer', data: '' }`.\n\n### `reviver(key, value)`\n\nA [`reviver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse#Using_the_reviver_parameter) implementation which turns every object of shape `{ type: 'Buffer', data: <array of numbers or string> }` into a `Buffer` instance.\n\n## Related modules\n\n- [`buffer-json-encoding`](https://github.com/lachenmayer/buffer-json-encoding): an [`abstract-encoding`](https://github.com/mafintosh/abstract-encoding) compatible JSON encoder/decoder which uses this module.\n\n## License\n\nMIT"

To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with\nimplementations like `kqueue` available on most \\*nix platforms. Chokidar still\ndoes have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.\n\nOn other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which\navoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate\nwatchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been\nspecified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much\nmore than needed.\n\n## Getting started\nInstall with npm:\n\n```sh\nnpm install chokidar\n```\n\nThen `require` and use it in your code:\n\n```javascript\nvar chokidar = require('chokidar');\n\n// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles\nchokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {\n  console.log(event, path);\n});\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Example of a more typical implementation structure:\n\n// Initialize watcher.\nvar watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {\n  ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../,\n  persistent: true\n});\n\n// Something to use when events are received.\nvar log = console.log.bind(console);\n// Add event listeners.\nwatcher\n  .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))\n  .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));\n\n// More possible events.\nwatcher\n  .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))\n  .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))\n  .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))\n  .on('raw', (event, path, details) => {\n    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);\n  });\n\n// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second\n// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats\nwatcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {\n  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);\n});\n\n// Watch new files.\nwatcher.add('new-file');\nwatcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);\n\n// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem\nvar watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();\n\n// Un-watch some files.\nwatcher.unwatch('new-file*');\n\n// Stop watching.\nwatcher.close();\n\n// Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example)\nchokidar.watch('file', {\n  persistent: true,\n\n  ignored: '*.txt',\n  ignoreInitial: false,\n  followSymlinks: true,\n  cwd: '.',\n  disableGlobbing: false,\n\n  usePolling: true,\n  interval: 100,\n  binaryInterval: 300,\n  alwaysStat: false,\n  depth: 99,\n  awaitWriteFinish: {\n    stabilityThreshold: 2000,\n    pollInterval: 100\n  },\n\n  ignorePermissionErrors: false,\n  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)\n});\n\n```\n\n## API\n\n`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`\n\n* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched\nrecursively, or glob patterns.\n* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:\n\n#### Persistence\n\n* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process\nshould continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to\n`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted\nafter `ready`, even if the process continues to run.\n\n#### Path filtering\n\n* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)\nDefines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is\ntested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it\ngets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second\ntime with two arguments (the path and the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject of that path).\n* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while\ninstantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).\n* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the\nsymlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following\nthe link references and bubbling events through the link's path.\n* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be\nderived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.\n* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as\nliteral path names, even if they look like globs.\n\n#### Performance\n\n* `usePolling` (default: `false`).\nWhether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling\nleads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is\ntypically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over\na network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other\nnon-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the\n`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable\nto true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.\n* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)\n  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also\n    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.\n  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system\n  polling for binary files.\n  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))\n* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the\n`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly\nand `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When\nset to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.\n* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set\nthis to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't\nalready available from the underlying watch events.\n* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of\nsubdirectories will be traversed.\n* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).\nBy default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before\nthe entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`\nevents will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,\nespecially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the\nwrite operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.\nSetting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,\nholding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a\nconfigurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily\ndependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should\nbe relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.\nUse with caution.\n  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust\n  timing params:*\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in\n  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.\n\n#### Errors\n* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files\nthat don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`\nor `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.\n* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).\nAutomatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use\n\"atomic writes\" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is\nre-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event\nrather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well\nfor you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in\nmilliseconds.\n\n### Methods & Events\n\n`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:\n\n* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.\nAvailable events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,\n`raw`, `error`.\nAdditionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event\nname and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.\n* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.\n* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file\nsystem being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the\ndirectories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the\nvalues are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.\n\n## CLI\n\nIf you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out\n[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to\nexecute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.\n\n## Install Troubleshooting\n\n* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`\n  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is\n    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,\n    Chokidar should function properly.\n\n* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable \"python\" is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`\n  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:\n    `npm config set python python2.7`\n\n* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`\n  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2019 Paul Miller (https://paulmillr.com) & Elan Shanker\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

But don't forget to whitelist it for transpilation:\n\n```js\nimport consola from 'consola/src/node'\nimport consola from 'consola/src/browser'\n```\n\n## Methods\n\n#### `<type>(logObject)` `<type>(args...)`\n\nLog to all reporters.\n\nExample: `consola.info('Message')`\n\nA list of available types can be found [here](./src/types.js).\n\n#### `addReporter(reporter)`\n\n- Aliases: `add`\n\nRegister a custom reporter instance.\n\n#### `removeReporter(reporter?)`\n\n- Aliases: `remove`, `clear`\n\nRemove a registered reporter.\n\nIf no arguments are passed all reporters will be removed.\n\n#### `setReporters(reporter|reporter[])`\n\nReplace all reporters.\n\n#### `create(options)`\n\nCreate a new `Consola` instance and inherit all parent options for defaults.\n\n#### `withDefaults(defaults)`\n\nCreate a new `Consola` instance with provided defaults\n\n#### `withTag(tag)`\n\n- Aliases: `withScope`\n\nCreate a new `Consola` instance with that tag.\n\n#### `wrapConsole()` `restoreConsole()`\n\nGlobally redirect all `console.log`, etc calls to consola handlers.\n\n#### `wrapStd()` `restoreStd()`\n\nGlobally redirect all stdout/stderr outputs to consola.\n\n#### `wrapAll()` `restoreAll()`\n\nWrap both, std and console.\n\nconsole uses std in the underlying so calling `wrapStd` redirects console too.\nBenefit of this function is that things like `console.info` will be correctly redirected to the corresponding type.\n\n#### `pauseLogs()` `resumeLogs()`\n\n- Aliases: `pause`/`resume`\n\n**Globally** pause and resume logs.\n\nConsola will enqueue all logs when paused and then sends them to the reported when resumed.\n\n#### `mockTypes`\n\n- Aliases: `mock`\n\nMock all types. Useful for using with tests.\n\nThe first argument passed to `mockTypes` should be a callback function accepting `(typeName, type)` and returning the mocked value:\n\n```js\nconsola.mockTypes((typeName, type) => jest.fn())\n```\n\nPlease note that with the example above, everything is mocked independently for each type. If you need one mocked fn create it outside:\n\n```js\nconst fn = jest.fn()\nconsola.mockTypes(() => fn)\n```\n\nIf callback function returns a _falsy_ value, that type won't be mocked.\n\nFor example if you just need to mock `consola.fatal`:\n\n```js\nconsola.mockTypes((typeName) => typeName === 'fatal' && jest.fn())\n```\n\n**NOTE:** Any instance of consola that inherits the mocked instance, will apply provided callback again.\nThis way, mocking works for `withTag` scoped loggers without need to extra efforts.\n\n## Fields\n\n#### `reporters`\n\nAn array of active reporters.\n\n#### `level`\n\nThe level to display logs. Any logs at or above this level will be displayed.\nList of available levels [here](./src/types.js).\n\nYou can set the log level using the `CONSOLA_LEVEL` environment variable, which must have the numeric log level as its value.\n\n## `logObject`\n\nThe `logObject` is a free-to-extend object which will be passed to reporters.\n\nStandard fields:\n\n- `message`\n- `additional`\n- `args`\n- `date`\n- `tag`\n\nExtra fields:\n\n- `badge`\n\n## Reporters\n\nChoose between one of the built-in reporters or bring in your own one.\n\nBy default `FancyReporter` is registered for modern terminals or `BasicReporter` will be used if running in limited environments such as CIs.\n\nAvailable reporters:\n\n- [BasicReporter](./src/reporters/basic.js)\n- [FancyReporter](./src/reporters/fancy.js)\n- [JSONReporter](./src/reporters/json.js)\n- [WinstonReporter](./src/reporters/winston.js)\n\n### Creating your own reporter\n\nA reporter (class or object) exposes `log(logObj)` method.\nTo get more info about how to write your own reporter, take a look into the linked implementations above.\n\n## Types\n\nTypes are used to actually log messages to the reporters.\nEach type is attached to a _logging level_.\n\nA list of all available default types is [here](./src/types.js).\n\n## Creating a new instance\n\nConsola has a global instance and is recommended to use everywhere.\nIn case more control is needed, create a new instance.\n\n```js\nimport consola from 'consola'\n\nconst logger = consola.create({\n    // level: 4,\n    reporters: [\n      new consola.JSONReporter()\n    ],\n    defaults: {\n      additionalColor: 'white'\n    }\n})\n```\n\n## Integrations\n\n### With jest\n\n```js\ndescribe('your-consola-mock-test', () => {\n  beforeAll(() => {\n      // Redirect std and console to consola too\n      // Calling this once is sufficient\n      consola.wrapAll()\n    })\n\n    beforeEach(() => {\n      // Re-mock consola before each test call to remove\n      // calls from before\n      consola.mockTypes(() => jest.fn())\n    })\n\n\n  test('your test', async () => {\n    // Some code here\n\n    // Let's retrieve all messages of `consola.log`\n    // Get the mock and map all calls to their first argument\n    const consolaMessages = consola.log.mock.calls.map(c => c[0])\n    expect(consolaMessages).toContain('your message')\n  })\n\n})\n```\n\n### With jsdom\n\n```js\n{\n  virtualConsole: new jsdom.VirtualConsole().sendTo(consola)\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT - Made with 💖 By Nuxt.js team!\n\n<!-- Refs -->\n[standard-js-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/badge/code%20style/standard/green\n[standard-js-href]: https://standardjs.com\n\n[npm-version-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/npm/v/consola/latest\n[npm-version-href]: https://npmjs.com/package/consola\n\n[npm-downloads-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/npm/dt/consola\n[npm-downloads-href]: https://npmjs.com/package/consola\n\n[package-phobia-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/packagephobia/install/consola\n[package-phobia-href]: https://packagephobia.now.sh/result?p=consola\n\n[bundle-phobia-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/bundlephobia/minzip/consola\n[bundle-phobia-href]: https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=consola"

Replace swig with whatever templating you are using. For example, use cons.hogan for hogan.js, cons.jade for jade, etc. `console.log(cons)` for the full list of identifiers.\n\n```js\nvar cons = require('consolidate');\ncons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(html);\n});\n```\n\n  Or without options / local variables:\n\n```js\nvar cons = require('consolidate');\ncons.swig('views/page.html', function(err, html){\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(html);\n});\n```\n\n  To dynamically pass the engine, simply use the subscript operator and a variable:\n\n```js\nvar cons = require('consolidate')\n  , name = 'swig';\n\ncons[name]('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(html);\n});\n```\n\n### Promises\n\n  Additionally, all templates optionally return a promise if no callback function is provided. The promise represents the eventual result of the template function which will either resolve to a string, compiled from the template, or be rejected. Promises expose a `then` method which registers callbacks to receive the promise’s eventual value and a `catch` method which the reason why the promise could not be fulfilled. Promises allow more synchronous-like code structure and solve issues like race conditions.\n\n```js\nvar cons = require('consolidate');\n\ncons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' })\n  .then(function (html) {\n    console.log(html);\n  })\n  .catch(function (err) {\n    throw err;\n  });\n```\n\n## Caching\n\n To enable caching simply pass `{ cache: true }`. Engines _may_ use this option to cache things reading the file contents, compiled `Function`s etc. Engines which do _not_ support this may simply ignore it. All engines that consolidate.js implements I/O for will cache the file contents, ideal for production environments.\n When using consolidate directly: `cons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi', cache:true }, callback);`\n Using Express 3 or higher: `app.locals.cache = true` or set NODE_ENV to 'production' and Express will do this for you.\n\n## Express 3.x example\n\n```js\nvar express = require('express')\n  , cons = require('consolidate')\n  , app = express();\n\n// assign the swig engine to .html files\napp.engine('html', cons.swig);\n\n// set .html as the default extension\napp.set('view engine', 'html');\napp.set('views', __dirname + '/views');\n\nvar users = [];\nusers.push({ name: 'tobi' });\nusers.push({ name: 'loki' });\nusers.push({ name: 'jane' });\n\napp.get('/', function(req, res){\n  res.render('index', {\n    title: 'Consolidate.js'\n  });\n});\n\napp.get('/users', function(req, res){\n  res.render('users', {\n    title: 'Users',\n    users: users\n  });\n});\n\napp.listen(3000);\nconsole.log('Express server listening on port 3000');\n```\n\n## Template Engine Instances\n\nTemplate engines are exposed via the `cons.requires` object, but they are not instantiated until you've called the `cons[engine].render()` method. You can instantiate them manually beforehand if you want to add filters, globals, mixins, or other engine features.\n\n```js\nvar cons = require('consolidate'),\n  nunjucks = require('nunjucks');\n\n// add nunjucks to requires so filters can be\n// added and the same instance will be used inside the render method\ncons.requires.nunjucks = nunjucks.configure();\n\ncons.requires.nunjucks.addFilter('foo', function () {\n  return 'bar';\n});\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n* If you're using Nunjucks, please take a look at the `exports.nunjucks.render` function in `lib.consolidate.js`.  You can pass your own engine/environment via `options.nunjucksEnv`, or if you want to support Express you can pass `options.settings.views`, or if you have another use case, pass `options.nunjucks` (see the code for more insight).\n* You can pass **partials** with `options.partials`\n* For using **template inheritance** with nunjucks, you can pass a loader\n  with `options.loader`.\n* To use **filters** with tinyliquid, use `options.filters` and specify an array of properties, each of which is a named filter function. A filter function takes a string as a parameter and returns a modified version of it.\n* To use **custom tags** with tinyliquid, use `options.customTags` to specify an array of tag functions that follow the tinyliquid [custom tag](https://github.com/leizongmin/tinyliquid/wiki/Custom-Tag) definition.\n* The default directory used with the **include** tag with tinyliquid is the current working directory. To override this, use `options.includeDir`.\n* `React` To render content into a html base template (eg. `index.html` of your React app), pass the path of the template with `options.base`.\n\n## Running tests\n\n  Install dev deps:\n\n    $ npm install -d\n\n  Run the tests:\n\n    $ make test\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011-2016 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/."

    "licenseText": "# CC0 1.0 Universal\n\n## Statement of Purpose\n\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer\nexclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and\nsubsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of\nauthorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).\n\nCertain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the\npurpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works\n(“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of\ninfringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and\nredistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,\nincluding without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/."

    "licenseText": "# C-like unsigned integers for Javascript\n\n## Synopsis\n\nJavascript does not natively support handling of unsigned 32 or 64 bits integers. This library provides that functionality, following C behaviour, enabling the writing of algorithms that depend on it. It was designed with performance in mind and tries its best to be as fast as possible. Any improvement is welcome!\n\n\n## How it works\n\nAn unsigned 32 bits integer is represented by an object with its first 16 bits (low bits) and its 16 last ones (high bits). All the supported standard operations on the unsigned integer are then performed transparently.\n\n\te.g.\n\t10000010000100000100010000100010 (2182104098 or 0x82104422) is represented by:\n\thigh=1000001000010000\n\tlow= 0100010000100010\n\nNB.\nIn case of overflow, the unsigned integer is _truncated_ to its lowest 32 bits (in case of UINT32) or 64  bits (in case of UINT64).\n\nThe same applies to 64 bits integers, which are split into 4 16 bits ones.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn nodejs:\n\n    npm install cuint\n\nIn the browser, include the following (file is located in the _build_ directory), and access the constructor with _UINT32_:\n\n`<script src=\"/your/path/to/uint32.js\"></script>\n...\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var v1 = UINT32('326648991');\n  var v2 = UINT32('265443576');\n  var v1plus2 = v1.add(v2) // 592092567\n</script>`\n\n## Usage\n\nTo instantiate an unsigned 32 bits integer, do any of the following:\n\n\tvar UINT32 = require('cuint').UINT32 // NodeJS\n\tUINT32( <low bits>, <high bits> )\n\tUINT32( <number> )\n\tUINT32( '<number>', <radix> ) // radix = 10 by default\n\nTo instantiate an unsigned 64 bits integer, do any of the following:\n\n\tvar UINT64 = require('cuint').UINT64 // NodeJS\n\tUINT64( <low bits>, <high bits> )\n\tUINT64( <first low bits>, <second low bits>, <first high bits>, <second high bits> )\n\tUINT64( <number> )\n\tUINT64( '<number>', <radix> ) // radix = 10 by default\n\n## Important\n\nMost methods __do modify__ the object they are applied to. For instance, the following is equivalent to `x += y`\n\n\tUINT(x).add( UINT(y) )\n\nThis allows for chaining and reduces the cost of the emulation.\nTo have `z = x + y`, do the following:\n\n    z = UINT(x).clone().add( UINT(y) )\n\n## Examples for UINT32\n\n* Using low and high bits\n> `UINT32( 2, 1 )\t\t// 65538`\n> { remainder: null, _low: 2, _high: 1 }\n\n* Using a number (signed 32 bits integer)\n> `UINT32( 65538 ) \t// 65538`\n> { remainder: null, _low: 2, _high: 1 }\n\n* Using a string\n> `UINT32( '65538' )\t// 65538`\n> { remainder: null, _low: 2, _high: 1 }\n\n* Using another string\n> `UINT32( '3266489917' )`\n> { remainder: null, _low: 44605, _high: 49842 }\n\n* Divide 2 unsigned 32 bits integers - note that the remainder is also provided\n> `UINT32( '3266489917' ).div( UINT32( '668265263' ) )`\n> {\tremainder:\n>\t\t\t{\tremainder: null\n>\t\t\t,\t_low: 385\n>\t\t\t,\t_high: 9055\n>\t\t\t}\n>\t,\t_low: 4\n>\t,\t_high: 0\n>\t}\n\n## Examples for UINT64\n\n* Using low and high bits\n> `UINT64( 2, 1 )\t\t// 4294967298`\n> { remainder: null, _a00: 2, _a16: 0, _a32: 1, _a48: 0 }\n\n* Using first/second low and high bits\n> `UINT64( 2, 1, 0, 0 )\t\t// 65538`\n> { remainder: null, _a00: 2, _a16: 1, _a32: 0, _a48: 0 }\n\n* Using a number (signed 32 bits integer)\n> `UINT64( 65538 ) \t// 65538`\n> { remainder: null, _a00: 2, _a16: 1, _a32: 0, _a48: 0 }\n\n* Using a string\n> `UINT64( '65538' )\t// 65538`\n> { remainder: null, _a00: 2, _a16: 1, _a32: 0, _a48: 0 }\n\n* Using another string\n> `UINT64( '3266489917' )`\n> { remainder: null, _a00: 44605, _a16: 49842, _a32: 0, _a48: 0 }\n\n* Divide 2 unsigned 64 bits integers - note that the remainder is also provided\n> `UINT64( 'F00000000000', 16 ).div( UINT64( '800000000000', 16 ) )`\n> { remainder: \n>   { remainder: null,\n>     _a00: 0,\n>     _a16: 0,\n>     _a32: 28672,\n>     _a48: 0 },\n>  _a00: 1,\n>  _a16: 0,\n>  _a32: 0,\n>  _a48: 0 }\n\n## Methods\n\nMethods specific to _UINT32_ and _UINT64_:\n\n* `UINT32.fromBits(<low bits>, <high bits>)*`\nSet the current _UINT32_ object with its low and high bits\n* `UINT64.fromBits(<low bits>, <high bits>)*`\nSet the current _UINT64_ object with its low and high bits\n* `UINT64.fromBits(<first low bits>, <second low bits>, <first high bits>, <second high bits>)*`\nSet the current _UINT64_ object with all its low and high bits\n\nMethods common to _UINT32_ and _UINT64_:\n\n* `UINT.fromNumber(<number>)*`\nSet the current _UINT_ object from a number (first 32 bits only)\n* `UINT.fromString(<string>, <radix>)`\nSet the current _UINT_ object from a string\n* `UINT.toNumber()`\nConvert this _UINT_ to a number\n* `UINT.toString(<radix>)`\nConvert this _UINT_ to a string\n* `UINT.add(<uint>)*`\nAdd two _UINT_.

Most of\nthe curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective\nor extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.\n\nAll operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is\nprovided by [hash.js][2]\n\n### Related projects\n\n* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both\n  browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for\n  node)\n\n#### LICENSE\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2014.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Available in npm as *errno*.\n\n[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno)\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno)\n[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno)\n\n* [errno exposed](#errnoexposed)\n* [Custom errors](#customerrors)\n\n<a name=\"errnoexposed\"></a>\n## errno exposed\n\nEver find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.\n\n**By errno:**\n\n```js\nrequire('errno').errno[3]\n// → {\n//     \"errno\": 3,\n//     \"code\": \"EACCES\",\n//     \"description\": \"permission denied\"\n//   }\n```\n\n**By code:**\n\n```js\nrequire('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY\n// → {\n//     \"errno\": 53,\n//     \"code\": \"ENOTEMPTY\",\n//     \"description\": \"directory not empty\"\n//   }\n```\n\n**Make your errors more descriptive:**\n\n```js\nvar errno = require('errno')\n\nfunction errmsg(err) {\n  var str = 'Error: '\n  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno\n  if (errno.errno[err.errno])\n    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description\n  else\n    str += err.message\n\n  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property\n  if (err.path)\n    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'\n\n  return str\n}\n\nvar fs = require('fs')\n\nfs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {\n  if (err)\n    console.log(errmsg(err))\n})\n```\n\n**Use as a command line tool:**\n\n```\n~ $ errno 53\n{\n  \"errno\": 53,\n  \"code\": \"ENOTEMPTY\",\n  \"description\": \"directory not empty\"\n}\n~ $ errno EROFS\n{\n  \"errno\": 56,\n  \"code\": \"EROFS\",\n  \"description\": \"read-only file system\"\n}\n~ $ errno foo\nNo such errno/code: \"foo\"\n```\n\nSupply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.\n\nYou will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.\n\n<a name=\"customerrors\"></a>\n## Custom errors\n\nUse `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.\n\n```js\nvar create = require('errno').custom.createError\nvar MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error\nvar SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError\nvar OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)\n\n// use them!\nif (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')\n\nif (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))\n```\n\nAlso available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:\n\n```js\nfs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {\n  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))\n  // do something else\n})\n```\n\nThe resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.\n\n## Contributors\n\n* [bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10) (Dave Eddy) - Added CLI\n* [ralphtheninja](https://github.com/ralphtheninja) (Lars-Magnus Skog)\n\n## Copyright & Licence\n\n*Copyright (c) 2012-2015 [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) ([@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg))*\n\nMade available under the MIT licence:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished\nto do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "licenseText": "### Esrecurse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse)\n\nEsrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is\n[ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)\nrecursive traversing functionality.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nThe following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(ast, {\n    XXXStatement: function (node) {\n        this.visit(node.left);\n        // do something...\n        this.visit(node.right);\n    }\n});\n```\n\nWe can use `Visitor` instance.\n\n```javascript\nvar visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({\n    XXXStatement: function (node) {\n        this.visit(node.left);\n        // do something...\n        this.visit(node.right);\n    }\n});\n\nvisitor.visit(ast);\n```\n\nWe can inherit `Visitor` instance easily.\n\n```javascript\nclass Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {\n    constructor()\n    {\n        super(null);\n    }\n\n    XXXStatement(node) {\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\nfunction DerivedVisitor() {\n    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);\n}\nutil.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);\nDerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {\n    this.visit(node.left);\n    // do something...\n    this.visit(node.right);\n};\n```\n\nAnd you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.\n\n```javascript\nfunction DerivedVisitor() {\n    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);\n}\nutil.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);\nDerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {\n    // do something...\n    this.visitChildren(node);\n};\n```\n\nThe `childVisitorKeys` option does customize the behaviour of `this.visitChildren(node)`.\nWe can use user-defined node types.\n\n```javascript\n// This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node.\nvar tree = {\n    type: 'TestExpression',\n\n    // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.\n    argument: {\n        type: 'Literal',\n        value: 20\n    },\n\n    // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.\n    extended: true\n};\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        // Extending the existing traversing rules.\n        childVisitorKeys: {\n            // TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]\n            TestExpression: ['argument']\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\nWe can use the `fallback` option as well.\nIf the `fallback` option is `\"iteration\"`, `esrecurse` would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes.\nPlease note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: 'iteration'\n    }\n);\n```\n\nIf the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.\nPlease note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: function (node) {\n            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {\n                return key !== 'argument'\n            });\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation)\n (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

    "licenseText": "iMurmurHash.js\n==============\n\nAn incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).\n\nThis version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

Note that in this case, all loaders will be resolved relative to the package containing your configuration.\n\nIn case part of your configuration comes from third-party packages that use their own loaders, make sure they use `require.resolve` - this will ensure that the resolution process is portable accross environments (including when Plug'n'Play isn't enabled), and prevent it from relying on undefined behaviors:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [{\n      test: /\\.js$/,\n      loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),\n    }]\n  },\n};\n```\n\n## License (MIT)\n\n> **Copyright © 2016 Maël Nison**\n>\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n>\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n>\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”).

In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”).

Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4.

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/."

Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/."

    "licenseText": "# CC0 1.0 Universal\n\n## Statement of Purpose\n\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer\nexclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and\nsubsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of\nauthorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).\n\nCertain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the\npurpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works\n(“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of\ninfringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and\nredistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,\nincluding without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/."

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/."

Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4.

Each priority level must finish entirely before the\nnext priority level is run.  See\n[PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is\neven true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue\ncan execute at once, for instance, with `maxConcurrency: 10`:\n\n```\n[ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ]\n```\n\n## API\n\n### const queue = new RunQueue(options)\n\nCreate a new queue. Options may contain:\n\n* maxConcurrency - (Default: `1`) The maximum number of jobs to execute at once.\n* Promise - (Default: global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.\n\n### queue.add (prio, fn, args)\n\nAdd a new job to the end of the queue at priority `prio` that will run `fn`\nwith `args`. If `fn` is async then it should return a Promise.\n\n### queue.run ()\n\nStart running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves when either\nall the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or returns a\nrejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will be rejected\nwith that error and no further queue running will be done.\n\n## PRIORITIES\n\nPriorities are any integer value >= 0.\n\nLowest is executed first.\n\nPriorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a queue\nmust complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed.\n\nThis means that if you have two queues, `0` and `1` then ALL jobs in `0`\nmust complete before ANY execute in `1`.  If you add new `0` level jobs\nwhile `1` level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the `0`\nqueue and won't execute any more `1` jobs till all of the new `0` jobs\ncomplete."

September 2020\n\nPräambel\n\nDie \"Helmholtz Earth and Environment\" Software-Infrastruktur-Lizenz \n(HEESIL) ist eine Lizenz mit Copyleft-Effekt für Software, Datenbankwerke \nund sonstige Werke, die im Rahmen zentrenübergreifender Aktivitäten \ndes Forschungsbereichs Erde und Umwelt der Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft \nerarbeitet, genutzt und/oder von den beteiligten Zentren dieses \nForschungsbereichs für Zwecke dieses Forschungsbereichs zur Verfügung \ngestellt werden. \n\nDie HEESIL regelt daher nur die Nutzung im Rahmen des Forschungsbereichs \nErde und Umwelt und der hierin aktiven Helmholtz-Zentren (\"Community\"). \nEine weitergehende Nutzung außerhalb dieser Community kann jederzeit \ngesondert mit den Lizenzgebenden vereinbart werden. \n\nDie HEESIL orientiert sich an der Open-Source-Lizenz für die Europäische \nUnion, EUPL v1.2, und ist damit speziell darauf ausgerichtet, dass die \nSoftware, die von den beteiligten Helmholtz-Zentren bereitgestellt wird, \ninnerhalb der Community frei genutzt und verteilt werden kann, dass die \nCommunity den Quellcode modifizieren und verändern kann, dass Teile davon \nin neuer Software verwendet oder integriert werden können und dass der \nmodifizierte Quellcode von Software oder modifizierte Software, die auf \ndem Quellcode basiert, der Community zur Verfügung gestellt wird.\n\nEine Nutzung darüber hinaus bedarf einer gesonderten Vereinbarung mit \ndem*der jeweiligen Lizenzgebenden. Diese Lizenz steht einer zukünftig \nweitergehenden Öffnung oder einer anderweitigen Lizenzierung nicht \nentgegen. Jeder*m Lizenzgebende*n bleibt vorbehalten, sein Werk im Wege \nder Multi-Lizenzierung neben einer HEESIL-Lizenzierung unter einer \nanderen Lizenz zu verbreiten und zugänglich zu machen.\n\n1.\tAnwendungsbereich\n\nDiese Lizenz HEESIL gilt nur für die Nutzung durch die Helmholtz-Zentren, \ndie im Forschungsbereich Erde und Umwelt der Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft \n(\"Community\", siehe \"Begriffsbestimmungen\") tätig sind, und nur für \neine nicht-kommerzielle Nutzung innerhalb der Community. \n\nHEESIL gilt für Werke (siehe \"Begriffsbestimmungen\"), die unter den \nBedingungen dieser Lizenz bereitgestellt werden. Das Werk darf nur \nin der durch diese Lizenz gestatteten Form genutzt werden. \n\nDas Werk wird unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz zur Verfügung gestellt, \nwenn die Lizenzgebenden (siehe \"Begriffsbestimmungen\") den folgenden \nHinweis unmittelbar nach dem Urheberrechtsvermerk für dieses Werks \nanbringen:\n\n\"Lizenziert unter HEESIL\" (eng.: \"Licensed under the HEESIL\")\n\noder auf andere Weise zum Ausdruck bringen, eine Lizenz unter HEESIL zu \nerteilen. Eine Empfehlung zur einheitlichen Anwendung der HEESIL auf \nein Werk oder seine Bearbeitungen ist im Anhang zu finden.\n\n2.

Eine \nVerbreitung oder Zugänglichmachung an dritte natürliche oder juristische \nPersonen außerhalb der Community darf nur zu nicht-kommerziellen Zwecken \nund nur für die Nutzung von wissenschaftlichen Services - die im Rahmen \nvon Aktivitäten des Forschungsbereichs Erde und Umwelt und/oder für \nZwecke dieses Forschungsbereichs angeboten werden - ohne Weitergabe des \nQuellcodes oder des ausführbaren Codes erfolgen (siehe auch 3.).\n\n- \"nicht-kommerziell\": Es erfolgt keine entgeltliche Verbreitung, \nZugänglichmachung oder sonstige wirtschaftliche Verwertung des Werks. \nEine kommerzielle Nutzung des Werks ist innerhalb oder außerhalb der \nCommunity nicht gestattet. \n\n3. Umfang der Lizenzrechte\n\nDie*Der Lizenzgebende erteilt Ihnen hiermit für die Gültigkeitsdauer \nder am Originalwerk bestehenden Urheberrechte eine weltweite, \nunentgeltliche, nicht ausschließliche Lizenz, die Sie berechtigt, \ninnerhalb der Community und nicht-kommerziell:\n\n- das Werk zu nutzen,\n\n- das Werk zu vervielfältigen,\n\n- das Werk zu verändern und Bearbeitungen auf der Grundlage des Werks \nzu schaffen,\n\n- das Werk innerhalb der Community als geschlossener Nutzergruppe \n(z.B. auf Infrastruktur-Plattformen oder Repositorien mit entsprechendem \nZugriffs- und Berechtigungskonzept) zugänglich zu machen, was das Recht \neinschließt, das Werk oder Vervielfältigungsstücke davon bereitzustellen \noder wahrnehmbar zu machen oder das Werk, soweit möglich, aufzuführen,\n\n- das Werk oder Vervielfältigungen davon zu verbreiten,\n\n- das Werk oder Vervielfältigungen davon für die lizenzgemäße Nutzung \ninnerhalb der Community weiter zu lizenzieren. Eine Unterlizensierung \nan dritte natürliche oder juristische Personen außerhalb der Community \nist nur zulässig, sofern dies ausschließlich für die wissenschaftliche \nNutzung von Services  der Community - die im Rahmen von Aktivitäten des \nForschungsbereichs Erde und Umwelt und/oder für Zwecke dieses \nForschungsbereichs angeboten werden -  nicht-kommerziell sowie ohne \nWeitergabe oder Offenlegung des Quellcodes oder des ausführbaren Codes \nund ohne Einräumung eines über eine bloße Nutzung hinausgehenden Rechts \nerfolgt. \n\nJegliche Nutzungen außerhalb des Forschungsbereichs Erde und Umwelt, \ndie kommerzielle Verwertung, die Nutzung in kommerziellen Kooperationen \noder in anderweitig finanzierten Aktivitäten (z.B. Einbringung als \nBackground-IP im Rahmen von drittmittelgeförderten Projekten, \nAuftragsforschung o.ä.) sind im Rahmen dieser Lizenz nicht erlaubt. \nHierfür können gesonderte Vereinbarungen mit den Lizenzgebenden \ngeschlossen werden. \n\n4. Zugänglichmachung des Quellcodes\n\nDie*Der Lizenzgebende kann das Werk entweder als Quellcode oder als \nausführbaren Code zur Verfügung stellen. Stellt sie*er es als \nausführbaren Code zur Verfügung, so stellt sie*er darüber hinaus eine \nmaschinenlesbare Kopie des Quellcodes für jedes von ihm*ihr verbreitete \nVervielfältigungsstück des Werks zur Verfügung, oder sie*er verweist in \neinem Vermerk im Anschluss an den dem Werk beigefügten Urheberrechtshinweis \nauf einen Speicherort, an dem problemlos und unentgeltlich durch die \nCommunity auf den Quellcode zugegriffen werden kann, z.B. einem \nSoftwarerepository mit Versionskontrollsystem, auch nach einem eventuellen \nAusscheiden der*des Lizenzgebenden aus der Community oder nach einer \nsonstigen Beendigung der Lizenz für oder durch die*den Lizenzgebenden.\n\n5. Pflichten der*des Lizenznehmenden\n\nDie Einräumung der oben genannten Rechte ist an mehrere Beschränkungen \nund Pflichten für die*den Lizenznehmenden gebunden:\n\n- Urheberrechtshinweis, Lizenztext, Nennung des Bearbeiters: Die*der \nLizenznehmende muss alle Urheberrechts-, Patent- oder Markenrechtshinweise \nund alle Hinweise auf die Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss unverändert \nlassen. Jedem von ihr*ihm innerhalb der Community verbreiteten oder \nzugänglich gemachten Vervielfältigungsstück des Werks muss die*der \nLizenznehmende diese Hinweise sowie diese Lizenz beifügen. Die*Der \nLizenznehmende muss auf jeder Bearbeitung weiterhin deutlich darauf \nhinweisen, dass das Werk geändert wurde, und das Datum der Bearbeitung \nangeben.\n\n- \"Copyleft\"-Klausel: Die*Der Lizenznehmende darf Vervielfältigungen \ndes Originalwerks oder Bearbeitungen nur unter den Bedingungen dieser \nHEESIL oder einer neueren Version dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder \nzugänglich machen, außer wenn das Originalwerk ausdrücklich nur unter \ndieser Lizenzversion - z. B. mit der Angabe \"Nur HEESIL v1.0\" - \nverbreitet werden darf. Die*Der Lizenznehmende (die*der dann zur*zum \nLizenzgebenden wird) darf für das Werk oder die Bearbeitung keine \nzusätzlichen Bedingungen anbieten oder vorschreiben, die den Bedingungen \ndieser Lizenz widersprechen oder diese einschränken.\n\n- Bereitstellung des Quellcodes: Wenn die*der Lizenznehmende \nVervielfältigungsstücke des Werks innerhalb der Community verbreitet \noder zugänglich macht, muss sie*er eine maschinenlesbare Fassung des \nQuellcodes mitliefern oder einen Speicherort angeben, über den \nproblemlos und unentgeltlich durch die Community so lange auf diesen \nQuellcode zugegriffen werden kann, wie die*der Lizenznehmende das \nWerk verbreitet oder zugänglich macht.\n\n- Zugriffsbeschränkungen: Außerhalb der Community ist eine Bereitstellung \noder Verbreitung des Quellcodes und des ausführbaren Codes untersagt. \nDie*Der Lizenznehmende hat insoweit alle Sicherheitsvorkehrungen zu \ntreffen, dass bei einer Bereitstellung von Services an dritte Nutzende \naußerhalb der Community (s. Umfang der Lizenz, Ziffer 3) kein Zugriff \nauf den Quellcode oder ausführbaren Code durch diese dritten Nutzenden \nermöglicht wird.\n\n- Beendigung: Bei einer Beendigung des Lizenzvertrags, z.B. durch \nAusscheiden der*des Lizenznehmenden aus der Community, hat die*der \nLizenznehmende sicherzustellen, dass das Werk nicht weiter durch \nsie*ihn, seine*ihre Angestellten, seine*ihre Beauftragten oder \nKooperationspartner genutzt wird und insbesondere diesen nicht mehr \nüber die*den Lizenznehmende*n zur Nutzung zur Verfügung steht.\n\n6. Urheberschaft und Bearbeitung\n\nDie*der ursprüngliche Lizenzgebende gewährleistet, dass sie*er befugt \nist, diese Lizenz zu erteilen.\n\nJede*r Bearbeitende gewährleistet, dass er*sie für die von ihm*ihr \nvorgenommenen Änderungen des Werks befugt ist, diese Lizenz zu erteilen. \nJede*r Bearbeitende wird insbesondere seine*ihre Bearbeitungen \nausschließlich unter Lizenzen erstellen, die kompatibel zu dieser \nHEESIL-Lizenz sind.\n\nJedes Mal, wenn Sie durch Nutzung des Werks die HEESIL-Lizenzbedingungen \nakzeptieren (siehe Ziff. 9), räumen Ihnen die*der ursprüngliche \nLizenzgebende und alle folgenden Bearbeitenden das Recht zur Nutzung \ndes Werks und seiner*ihrer Bearbeitungen unter den Bedingungen dieser \nLizenz ein.\n\n7. Gewährleistungsausschluss\n\nDie Arbeit an diesem Werk wird laufend fortgeführt; es wird durch \nunzählige Bearbeitende ständig verbessert. Das Werk ist nicht vollendet \nund kann daher Fehler (\"bugs\") enthalten, die dieser Art der Entwicklung \ninhärent sind.\n\nAus den genannten Gründen wird das Werk unter dieser Lizenz \"so, wie \nes ist\" ohne jegliche Gewährleistung zur Verfügung gestellt. Dies gilt \nunter anderem - aber nicht ausschließlich - für die Verwendbarkeit des \nWerks für einen bestimmten Zweck, Mängelfreiheit, Richtigkeit sowie \nNichtverletzung von anderen Immaterialgüterrechten als dem Urheberrecht.\n\n8. Haftungsausschluss/Haftungsbeschränkung\n\nAußer in Fällen von Vorsatz oder grober Fahrlässigkeit oder bei Schäden, \ndie natürlichen Personen aus der Verletzung des Lebens, des Körpers oder \nder Gesundheit entstehen, haftet die*der Lizenzgebende nicht für direkte \noder indirekte, materielle oder immaterielle Schäden irgendwelcher Art, \ndie aus der Lizenz oder der Benutzung des Werks folgen; dies gilt unter \nanderem, aber nicht ausschließlich, für Computerausfall oder \nComputerfehler, Datenverlust oder wirtschaftliche Schäden, und zwar auch \ndann, wenn die*der Lizenzgebende auf die Möglichkeit solcher Schäden \nhingewiesen wurde. Unabhängig davon haftet die*der Lizenzgebende im \nRahmen der gesetzlichen Produkthaftung, soweit die entsprechenden \nRegelungen auf das Werk anwendbar sind.\n\n9. Annahme der Lizenz\n\nIndem Sie ein Recht ausüben, das in Artikel 3 dieser Lizenz aufgeführt \nist, wie das Erstellen einer Bearbeitung oder die Verbreitung oder \nZugänglichmachung des Werks oder dessen Vervielfältigungen, stimmen \nSie der Lizenz in der angegebenen Version und den darin enthaltenen \nKlauseln und Bedingungen eindeutig und unwiderruflich zu. Sollten Sie \nden HEESIL-Lizenzbedingungen nicht zustimmen, ist eine Nutzung des Werks \nnicht gestattet.\n\n10. Beendigung der Lizenz\n\nDie Lizenz und die damit eingeräumten Rechte erlöschen automatisch, \nwenn die*der Lizenznehmende gegen die Lizenzbedingungen verstößt. \nDas Recht zur Nutzung des Werks und/oder seiner Bearbeitungen endet \ndamit.\n\nHandelt es sich bei der*dem Lizenznehmenden um eine natürliche Person, \ndie an einem Helmholtz-Zentrum angestellt oder von einem \nHelmholtz-Zentrum der Community beauftragt wurde, endet die Lizenz \nebenfalls, wenn die Anstellung dieser natürlichen Personen am \nHelmholtz-Zentrum oder die Beauftragung endet. \n\nScheidet eine lizenznehmende juristische Person aus der Community \naus, ist die Lizenz beendet und die ausscheidende lizenznehmende \njuristische Person hat sicherzustellen, dass das Werk durch sie, \nihre Angestellten, ihre Beauftragten, ihre Kooperationspartner und \nDritte nicht mehr genutzt wird, sofern diese nicht selbst weiterhin \nTeil der Community bleiben. Der Abschluss einer gesonderten Lizenz \nmit der*dem jeweiligen Lizenzgebenden bleibt der*dem ausscheidenden \nLizenznehmenden vorbehalten. Sofern ausscheidende Lizenznehmende \nzugleich Lizenzgebende nach dieser Lizenz sind, bleibt die Lizenz \nan ihren Werken auch nach ihrem Ausscheiden in Kraft.\n\nEin Erlöschen der Lizenz bei den Lizenznehmenden nach vorgenannten \nGründen führt nicht zum Erlöschen von Unterlizensierungen, die diese \nLizenznehmenden gemäß dieser Lizenz berechtigt an dritte natürliche \noder juristische Personen erteilt haben, solange diese dritten \nPersonen die Lizenzbedingungen erfüllen. \n\n11. Sonstiges\n\nSind einzelne Bestimmungen der Lizenz nach geltendem deutschen Recht \nnichtig oder unwirksam, so berührt dies nicht die Wirksamkeit oder \nDurchsetzbarkeit der Lizenz an sich. Solche Bestimmungen werden vielmehr \nso ausgelegt oder modifiziert, dass sie wirksam und durchsetzbar sind.\n\n12. Gütliche Einigung, Mediation, Geltendes Recht\n\nEventuelle Streitigkeiten zwischen Lizenzgeber und Lizenznehmer sollen \ngütlich beigelegt werden. Wenn eine gütliche Lösung nicht möglich ist, \nwerden die Parteien eine Mediation durchführen. Sofern die Parteien \nnichts anderes vereinbaren, ist Ort der Mediation Potsdam. Die Lizenz \nunterliegt deutschem Recht.\n\n13. Neue Versionen der Lizenz\n\nNeue Versionen dieser Lizenz sind einstimmig durch die zum Zeitpunkt der \nVerabschiedung im Forschungsbereich Erde und Umwelt tätigen Helmholtz-Zentren \n(vgl. 2. Community, Liste der Zentren) zu verabschieden. Eine Zustimmung \ndarf nicht ohne sachlichen Grund verweigert werden und gilt als erteilt, \nsofern ein Zentrum nicht innerhalb von 30 Tagen nach Mitteilung über \neine neue Version dem Anfragenden etwas Anderes mitteilt. Kann keine \nEinstimmigkeit erzielt werden, ist eine Lösung über Mediation zu finden.\n\nNeue Versionen dürfen den Schutzumfang dieser Version 1.0 der HEESIL, \nwie er in der Präambel und im Anwendungsbereich beschrieben ist, nicht \nerweitern: Die Lizenz darf auch in zukünftigen Versionen nur eine \nnicht-kommerzielle Nutzung innerhalb der Community erlauben und muss \nunter Copyleft-Effekt stehen. \n\nDie Lizenz wird in allen verfügbaren Versionen öffentlich zur Verfügung \ngestellt.\n\n\nANHANG: \nEmpfehlung zur Anwendung der HEESIL auf Ihr Werk oder Ihre Bearbeitungen\n\nZur Anwendung der HEESIL auf Ihr Werk oder auf Bearbeitungen eines \nHEESIL lizenzierten Werkes sollte jede Datei eines Beitrags (Contribution) \nzum Speicherort einen Hinweis auf die Lizenz enthalten. Der Hinweis \nsollte an den Anfang jeder Datei gesetzt werden. Dabei sollte jede Datei \nmindestens die Copyright-Zeile und einen Verweis darauf enthalten, wo \nsich der vollständige Lizenztext befindet. Der vollständige Lizenztext \nist in einer Datei im Stammverzeichnis des Speicherorts mit dem Namen \nLICENSE, LICENSE.md oder LICENSE.txt zu hinterlegen.\n\nEs wird empfohlen, die folgende Vorlage für den Hinweis am Anfang jeder \nDatei hinzuzufügen - bzw. einen bereits existierenden Hinweis - mit den \nentsprechenden Informationen zu ergänzen. Geben Sie Ihre Informationen \nfür die in spitzen Klammern \"<>\" eingeschlossenen Felder ein - und \nlassen Sie die spitzen Klammern dabei weg. Stellen Sie sicher, dass \nSie nur die für Ihre Arbeit relevanten Informationen eingeben. Kopieren \nSie keine Informationen wie Namen und Projekte aus anderen Dateien, \ndie nicht zu Ihrer Arbeit gehören, und fügen Sie sie nicht ein. Der \nText ist in der entsprechenden Kommentarsyntax der Programmiersprache, \nAuszeichnungssprache oder des Dateiformats am Anfang der Datei hinzuzufügen.\n\nUm sich die Arbeit zu erleichtern, können Sie beim Erstellen von Dateien \neinen mit Ihren Angaben ausgefüllten Hinweis am Anfang jeder Datei \nautomatisch hinzufügen, indem Sie die Funktionen Ihrer \nSoftwareentwicklungsumgebung oder andere Automatisierungs-optionen in \nIhrem Entwicklungsprozess verwenden.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    <optionally, description of purpose for this file.>\n    \n    Copyright (C) <year>\n    - <name of author> (<acronym of employer>, <email address of author>), \n    - <name of author> (<acronym of employer>, <email address of author>), \n    - ...\n    - <name of employer> (<acronym of employer>, <website URL of employer>), \n    - <name of employer> (<acronym of employer>, <website URL of employer>), \n    - ...\n    \n    Parts of this program <(especially the code for whatever)> \n    were developed within the context of the following publicly funded \n    projects or measures:\n    - <project name>, <funding agency, grant, programme>, \n      <grant agreement number> (<website URL>), \n    - <project name>, <funding agency, grant, programme>,\n      <grant agreement number> (<website URL>), \n    - ...\n\n    Licensed under the HEESIL, Version 1.0 or - as soon they will be \n    approved by the \"Community\" - subsequent versions of the HEESIL \n    (the \"Licence\").\n    \n    You may not use this work except in compliance with the Licence.\n    \n    You may obtain a copy of the Licence at: \n    https://gitext.gfz-potsdam.de/software/heesil\n    \n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software \n    distributed under the Licence is distributed on an \"AS IS\" basis, \n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or \n    implied.

    "licenseText": "# sirv ![CI](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/workflows/CI/badge.svg)\n\n> The optimized and lightweight middleware for serving requests to static assets\n\nYou may use `sirv` as a *very* fast and lightweight alternative to [`serve-static`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-static).\n\nThe massive performance advantage over `serve-static` is explained by **not** relying on the file system for existence checks on every request. These are expensive interactions and must be avoided whenever possible! Instead, when not in \"dev\" mode, `sirv` performs all its file-system operations upfront and then relies on its cache for future operations.\n\nThis middleware will work out of the box for [Polka](https://github.com/lukeed/polka), Express, and other Express-like frameworks. It will also work with the native `http`, `https` and `http2` modules. It requires _very_ little effort to modify/wrap it for servers that don't accept the `(req, res, next)` signature.\n\n:bulb: For a feature-complete CLI application, check out the sibling [`sirv-cli`](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/tree/master/packages/sirv-cli) package as an alternative to [`zeit/serve`](https://github.com/zeit/serve)~!\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install --save sirv\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst sirv = require('sirv');\nconst polka = require('polka');\nconst compress = require('compression')();\n\n// Init `sirv` handler\nconst assets = sirv('public', {\n  maxAge: 31536000, // 1Y\n  immutable: true\n});\n\npolka()\n  .use(compress, assets)\n  .use('/api', require('./api'))\n  .listen(3000, err => {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log('> Ready on localhost:3000~!');\n  });\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n### sirv(dir, opts={})\n\nReturns: `Function`\n\nThe returned function is a middleware in the standard Express-like signature: `(req, res, next)`, where `req` is the [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), `res` is the [`http.ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v9.x/docs/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse), and `next` (in this case) is the function to call if no file was found for the given path.\n\nWhen defined, a `next()` callback is always called _instead of_ the [`opts.onNoMatch`](#optsonnomatch) callback. However, unlike `onNoMatch`, your `next()` is given no arguments.\n\n#### dir\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `.`\n\nThe directory from which to read and serve assets. It is resolved to an absolute path &mdash; you must provide an absolute path yourself if `process.cwd()` is not the correct assumption.\n\n#### opts.dev\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nEnable \"dev\" mode, which disables/skips caching. Instead, `sirv` will traverse the file system ***on every request***.\n\nAdditionally, `dev` mode will ignore `maxAge` and `immutable` as these options generate a production-oriented `Cache-Control` header value.\n\n> **Important:** Do not use `dev` mode in production!\n\n#### opts.etag\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nGenerate and attach an `ETag` header to responses.\n\n> **Note:** If an incoming request's [`If-None-Match` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-None-Match) matches the `ETag` value, a `304` response is given.\n\n#### opts.dotfiles\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nAllow requests to dotfiles (files or directories beginning with a `.`).\n\n> **Note:** Requests to [`/.well-known/*`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8615) are always allowed.\n\n#### opts.extensions\nType: `Array<String>`<br>\nDefault: `['html', 'htm']`\n\nThe file extension fallbacks to check for if a pathame is not initially found. For example, if a `/login` request cannot find a `login` filename, it will then look for `login.html` and `login.htm` before giving up~!\n\n> **Important:** Actually, `sirv` will **also** look for `login/index.html` and `login/index.htm` before giving up.\n\n#### opts.gzip\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nDetermine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.gz` files.<br>\nMust be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include \"gzip\" in order for `sirv` to search for the gzip'd alternative.\n\n> **Note:** The `.gz` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.\n\n```js\n// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE\n// Showing lookup logic\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] \"/foobar.jpg\"\nlookup([\n  '/foobar.jpg.gz', '/foobar.jpg',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.gz',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.gz',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',\n]);\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] \"/\"\nlookup([\n  '/index.html.gz',\n  '/index.htm.gz',\n  '/index.html',\n  '/index.htm',\n]);\n```\n\n\n#### opts.brotli\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nDetermine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.br` files.<br>\nMust be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include either \"br\" or \"brotli\" in order for `sirv` to search for the brotli-compressed alternative.\n\n> **Note:** The `.br` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.\n\nWhen both `opts.broli` and `opts.gzip` are enabled &mdash; and all conditions are equal &mdash; then the brotli variant always takes priority.\n\n```js\n// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE\n// Showing lookup logic\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br] \"/foobar.jpg\"\nlookup([\n  '/foobar.jpg.br', '/foobar.jpg',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.br',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.br',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',\n]);\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br,gz] \"/\"\nlookup([\n  '/index.html.br'\n  '/index.htm.br'\n  '/index.html.gz'\n  '/index.htm.gz'\n  '/index.html'\n  '/index.htm'\n]);\n```\n\n#### opts.maxAge\nType: `Number`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nEnables the `Cache-Control` header on responses and sets the `max-age` value (in seconds).<br>\nFor example, `maxAge: 31536000` is equivalent to one year.\n\n#### opts.immutable\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nAppends the [`immutable` directive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#Revalidation_and_reloading) on your `Cache-Control` header, used for uniquely-named assets that will not change!\n\n> **Important:** Will only work if `opts.maxAge` has a value defined!\n\n#### opts.single\nType: `Boolean` or `String`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nTreat the directory as a single-page application.\n\nWhen `true`, the directory's index page (default `index.html`) will be sent if the request asset does not exist.<br>\nYou may pass a `string` value to use a file _instead of_ `index.html` as your fallback.\n\nFor example, if \"/about\" is requested but no variants of that file exist, then the response for \"/\" is sent instead:\n\n```js\n// Note: This is psuedo code to illustrate what's happening\n\n// Request: \"/about\"\nlet file = find(['/about', '/about.html', '/about.htm', '/about/index.html', '/about.htm']);\nif (file) {\n  send(file);\n} else if (opts.single === true) {\n  file = find(['/', '/index.html', '/index.htm']);\n  send(file);\n} else if (typeof opts.single === 'string') {\n  file = find([opts.single]);\n  send(file);\n} else {\n  // next() or 404\n}\n```\n\n#### opts.ignores\nType: `false` or `Array<String | RegExp>`\n\nSpecify paths/patterns that should ignore the fallback behavior that `opts.single` provides.\n\nBy default, any asset-like path (URLs that end with an extension) will be ignored. This means that, for example, if `/foobar.jpg` is not found, a `404` response is sent instead of the `index.html` fallback.\n\nAdditionally, any `/.well-known/*` pathname ignores the fallback – as do all other dotfile requests when `opts.dotfiles` is enabled.\n\nAny string value(s) will be passed through `new RegExp(value, 'i')` directly.\n\nFinally, you may set `ignores: false` to disable ***all*** ignores, including the defaults. Put differently, this will fallback ***all*** unknown pathnames to your `index.html` (or custom `opts.single` value).\n\n> **Important:** Only has an effect if `opts.single` is enabled.\n\n#### opts.onNoMatch\nType: `Function`\n\nA custom function to run if a file cannot be found for a given request. <br>By default, `sirv` will send a basic `(404) Not found` response.\n\nThe function receives the current `req <IncomingMessage>, res <ServerResponse>` pair for as its two arguments.\n\n> **Note:** This won't run if a `next` callback has been provided to the middleware; see [`sirv`](#sirvdir-opts) description.\n\n#### opts.setHeaders\nType: `Function`\n\nA custom function to append or change any headers on the outgoing response. There is no default.\n\nIts signature is `(res, pathname, stats)`, where `res` is the `ServerResponse`, `pathname` is incoming request path (stripped of queries), and `stats` is the file's result from [`fs.statSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_statsync_path).\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Luke Edwards](https://lukeed.com)"

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

To do an in-place\nsort, use `stable.inplace`, which otherwise works the same:\n\n```js\nconst arr = [10, 1, 5]\nstable(arr) === arr          // => false\nstable.inplace(arr) === arr  // => true\n```\n\nA comparator function can be specified:\n\n```js\n// Regular sort() compatible comparator, that returns a number.\n// This demonstrates the default behavior.\nconst lexCmp = (a, b) => String(a).localeCompare(b)\nstable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], lexCmp)  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']\n\n// Boolean comparator. Sorts `b` before `a` if true.\n// This demonstrates a simple way to sort numerically.\nconst greaterThan = (a, b) => a > b\nstable([10, 1, 5], greaterThan)  // => [1, 5, 10]\n```\n\n#### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2018 Angry Bytes and contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If you just want to write TypeScript and have it Just Work™, take a look at [`pnp-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin#ts-loader-integration) instead.*\n\nThis package exports a function that can be used to implement the [`resolveModuleName` hook from `CompilerHost`](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API#customizing-module-resolution). It mimics the interface from the one you'd typically use and, as all other PnP plugins, works just fine whether your application is actually running under PnP or not.\n\n```js\nimport {resolveModuleName} from 'ts-pnp';\nimport * as ts from 'typescript';\n\nfunction createCompilerHost(\n  compilerOptions: ts.CompilerOptions,\n): ts.CompilerHost {\n  const compilerHost = {\n    resolveModuleNames,\n    resolveTypeReferenceDirectives,\n  };\n\n  return compilerHost;\n\n  function resolveModuleNames(moduleNames: string[], containingFile: string) {\n    return moduleNames.map(moduleName => {\n      return resolveModuleName(moduleName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveModuleName).resolvedModule;\n    });\n  }\n\n  function resolveTypeReferenceDirectives(typeDirectiveNames: string[], containingFile: string) {\n    return typeDirectiveNames.map(typeDirectiveName => {\n      return resolveModuleName(typeDirectiveName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveTypeReferenceDirective).resolvedTypeReferenceDirective;\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## License (MIT)\n\n> **Copyright © 2016 Maël Nison**\n>\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n>\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n>\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

    "licenseText": "This is an internal package used by `vue-loader` and `vueify`. It processes the raw render functions generated by `vue-template-compiler` to:\n\n1. add support to ES2015 features in template expressions via Buble. (see [supported features here](https://buble.surge.sh/guide/#supported-features)).\n\n**Note:** since version 1.8.0, object rest spread usage inside templates are transpiled to `Object.assign` calls by default. This means if you need to support IE, you will need to polyfill `Object.assign`. (Latest version of Vue CLI will do this for you).\n\n2. remove the `with` block inside render functions to make it strict-mode compliant. This is performed only at build time so that the base template compiler can be extremely small and lightweight.\n\nThe buble implementation is built from a fork at https://github.com/yyx990803/buble"
