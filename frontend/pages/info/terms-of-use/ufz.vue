        I. Scope of licenses and usage
      </h2>
      <h3 class="mb-2">
        1. Allowed Use
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Services provide data and information supplied by UFZ as well as obtained on the basis of data and software
        provided by third parties (“third party material”). When using the services, you must always comply with the
        licensing conditions of the third-party material as given by the third parties and provide the relevant
        copyright notice (see Art. II). In case of doubt about the permitted use, you must contact the copyright holder
        directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as it would not be in contrast to the licenses of used third party material, the Services and provided
        data can be used for scientific, educational, informational and research purposes. Within this purpose, you are
        requested not to make the data available for download elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        A commercial use is explicitly forbidden and requires a separate agreement; please contact UFZ or – if
        applicable – the respective copyright holder of the data, information or Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Services rendered in connection with the sensor management system encompass the storage of data and
        information previously collected by the user group. The data may only be read, modified, recreated and stored by
        persons authorised to access.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data may only be used for official purposes, i.e. for the UFZ directly and for projects, initiatives and
        systems associated with the UFZ.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mb-2">
        2. Unacceptable Use
      </h3>
      <p>The following uses of the Services are strictly forbidden and may result in IP blocking when doing so:</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            heavy use of the Services by an application or individual person; examples of heavy use include: using our
            Services as a fallback for your own services, more than 500 requests within one minute, more than 5000
            requests within one hour;
          </li>
          <li>seeding or crawling the Services;</li>
          <li>sending the same request multiple times in a short period of time;</li>
          <li>monitoring the Services in a periodical manner;</li>
          <li>bulk downloading, unless explicitly permitted (see next paragraph I. (3))</li>
          <li>attempting to circumvent administrative authorisations and security mechanisms.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, the following conditions must be complied with when using the Services:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>no uploading of private content;</li>
          <li>no uploading of illegal content;</li>
          <li>
            no uploading of content that breaches copyright regulations, personality rights, or confidentiality
            obligations signed in connection with your work. In the event of a violation of these conditions, the
            respective home institution will be notified. The institution will then decide on any necessary legal action.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3 class="mb-2">
        3. Bulk Downloading
      </h3>
      <p>
        As a general rule, bulk downloading of larger amounts of data is not permitted. Smaller one-time bulk downloads
        may be possible if you ask the system administrators for permission to do so. The following additional rules
        apply to those bulk downloads:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>limit your request to a single thread;</li>
          <li>request from one machine only, no distributed scripts (e.g. a cluster or cloud service)</li>
          <li>results must be cached on your side, so clients repeatedly sending the same request may be blocked.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
