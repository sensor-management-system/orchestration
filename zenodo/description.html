    In the field of Earth System Science, the comprehensive understanding of
    complex spatio-temporal environmental processes and the prediction of future
    trends rely heavily on careful data collection, analysis, and
    interpretation. Time series data, a critical output of these efforts,
    play a central role in revealing patterns, identifying changes, and
    guiding decision making in various environmental domains.
    Despite the availability of dedicated time series databases to support the
    development of time series management systems, the effective management
    of associated metadata, sources, and key factors affecting usability and
    interpretability remains an ongoing challenge.

    The Sensor Management System (SMS), a joint initiative of the
    Helmholtz Centres UFZ, GFZ, FZJ, and KIT within the DataHub initiative,
    closes this gap by supporting scientists and technicians in the management of sensors,
    measurement setups, and campaigns. SMS features a modern and
    user-friendly interface coupled with a robust JSON:API and the OGC SensorML
    standard for data exchange.
    It includes an OAuth-based authentication system using the Helmholtz AAI,
    complemented by a sophisticated rights management structure.
    Sensor attributes within SMS adhere to a unified metadata catalogue that includes mandatory,
    optional, and user-specific attributes. The SMS provides traceability and provenance tracking.
    Interfaces to handle systems such as B2INST allow persistent identifiers to be generated.
