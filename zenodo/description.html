<h2>Sensor Management System</h2>

<p>
    The Sensor Management System (SMS) allows the comprehensive
    acquisition, administration and export of metadata of platforms,
    sensors and measurement configurations by stations and campaigns
    operated in the Helmholtz research field Earth & Environment.
</p>

<p>
    Information on specific setups can be summarized and made available
    as metadata together with the data for scientific evaluations,
    making the data genesis permanently traceable and transparent via
    provenance tracking. In the data management cycle, the service
    particularly supports the acquisition of additional information
    during data collection and prepares the publication of research
    data with associated metadata by capturing and providing relevant
    information about the measurement setup during data generation.
    The service is targeted at the work of scientists and technicians
    in the earth and environmental sciences, but also offers sufficient
    flexibility for use in other domains as well as individual extension
    and customization possibilities due to the use of common standards.
