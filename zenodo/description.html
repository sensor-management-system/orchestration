<h2>Sensor Management System</h2>

<!-- My old part -->
<!--
<p>
    The Sensor Management System (SMS) allows the comprehensive
    acquisition, administration and export of metadata of platforms,
    sensors and measurement configurations by stations and campaigns
    operated in the Helmholtz research field Earth & Environment.
</p>

<p>
    Information on specific setups can be summarized and made available
    as metadata together with the data for scientific evaluations,
    making the data genesis permanently traceable and transparent via
    provenance tracking. In the data management cycle, the service
    particularly supports the acquisition of additional information
    during data collection and prepares the publication of research
    data with associated metadata by capturing and providing relevant
    information about the measurement setup during data generation.
    The service is targeted at the work of scientists and technicians
    in the earth and environmental sciences, but also offers sufficient
    flexibility for use in other domains as well as individual extension
    and customization possibilities due to the use of common standards.

<!-- What David prepared: -->
<p>
    In the field of Earth System Science, the comprehensive understanding of
    complex spatio-temporal environmental processes and the prediction of future
    trends rely heavily on careful data collection, analysis, and
    interpretation. Time series data, a critical output of these efforts,
    play a central role in revealing patterns, identifying changes, and
    guiding decision making in various environmental domains.
    Despite the availability of dedicated time series databases to support the
    development of time series management systems, the effective management
    of associated metadata, sources, and key factors affecting usability and
    interpretability remains an ongoing challenge.

<p>
    The Sensor Management System (SMS), a joint initiative of the
    Helmholtz Centres UFZ, GFZ, FZJ, and KIT within the DataHub initiative,
    closes this gap by supporting scientists and technicians in the management of sensors,
    measurement setups, and campaigns. SMS features a modern and
    user-friendly interface coupled with a robust JSON:API and the OGC SensorML
    standard for data exchange.
    It includes an OAuth-based authentication system using the Helmholtz AAI,
    complemented by a sophisticated rights management structure.
    Sensor attributes within SMS adhere to a unified metadata catalogue that includes mandatory,
    optional, and user-specific attributes.
