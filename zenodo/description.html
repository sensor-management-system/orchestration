    In the field of Earth System Science, the comprehensive understanding of
    complex spatio-temporal environmental processes and the prediction of future
    trends rely heavily on careful data collection, analysis, and
    interpretation. And in particular time series data from sensor systems play a 
    central role in revealing patterns, identifying changes, evaluating model systems 
    and, ultimately, guiding decision making in various environmental domains. But
    despite the availability of dedicated time series databases to support the development 
    of time series management systems, it has been recognized that also
    the collection, management, and provision of associated sensor metadata is crucial 
    for ensuring sensor data usability and interpretability.

<p>
    In this context, the four Helmholtz Centers UFZ, GFZ, FZJ, and KIT from the Research 
    Field <a href="https://www.helmholtz.de/en/research/research-fields/earth-and-environment/">Earth and Environment</a> jointly develop a dedicated open-source platform for enabling 
    a FAIR and consistent management of such precious sensor metadata - the so-called Sensor
    Management System (SMS). This system supports scientists and technicians in the 
    harmonized and user-friendly management of sensors, measurement setups, and campaigns. 
    It features a modern and user-friendly interface coupled with a robust JSON:API 
    and supports the OGC SensorML standard for data exchange. It includes an OAuth-based 
    authentication system using the Helmholtz AAI, complemented by a sophisticated rights 
    management structure. Sensor attributes within SMS adhere to a unified metadata catalog 
    that includes mandatory, optional, and user-specific attributes. The SMS provides 
    traceability and provenance tracking. Interfaces to handle systems such as B2INST allow 
    persistent identifiers to be generated.
</p>

<p>
    The SMS is being developed as part of the <a href="https://earth-data.de">DataHub</a>, 
    an initiative that implements a uniform and FAIR research data infrastructure across the 
    seven Helmholtz Centers of the Research Field Earth and Environment.
