<h2>Sensor Management System</h2>

<!-- My old part -->
<!--
<p>
    The Sensor Management System (SMS) allows the comprehensive
    acquisition, administration and export of metadata of platforms,
    sensors and measurement configurations by stations and campaigns
    operated in the Helmholtz research field Earth & Environment.
</p>

<p>
    Information on specific setups can be summarized and made available
    as metadata together with the data for scientific evaluations,
    making the data genesis permanently traceable and transparent via
    provenance tracking. In the data management cycle, the service
    particularly supports the acquisition of additional information
    during data collection and prepares the publication of research
    data with associated metadata by capturing and providing relevant
    information about the measurement setup during data generation.
    The service is targeted at the work of scientists and technicians
    in the earth and environmental sciences, but also offers sufficient
    flexibility for use in other domains as well as individual extension
    and customization possibilities due to the use of common standards.

<!-- What David prepared: -->
<p>
    In the domain of earth system sciences, the comprehensive understanding of
    complex spatiotemporal environmental processes and the prediction of future
    trends rely heavily on meticulous data collection, analysis, and
    interpretation. Time series data, a critical outcome of these endeavors,
    assumes a central role in uncovering patterns, identifying changes, and
    guiding decision-making across diverse environmental domains.
    Despite the presence of dedicated time series databases supporting the
    development of time series management systems, the effective handling
    of associated metadata, sources, and key factors influencing usability and
    interpretability remains an ongoing challenge.

<p>
    The Sensor Data Management System (SMS), a collaborative initiative by
    Helmholtz Centres UFZ, GFZ, FZJ, and KIT within the DataHub initiative,
    bridges this gap by assisting scientists and technicians in managing sensors,
    measurement setups, and campaigns. SMS features a contemporary and
    user-friendly interface coupled with a robust API.
    It incorporates an OAuth-based authentication system using the Helmholtz AAI,
    supplemented by a sophisticated rights management structure.
    Sensor attributes within SMS adhere to a unified metadata catalog, encompassing obligatory,
    optional, and user-specific attributes.

    Presently operational at GFZ (https://sensors.gfz-potsdam.de/),
    UFZ (https://web.app.ufz.de/sms/), and KIT (https://sms.atmohub.kit.edu/),
    the sensor management system provides a decentralized solution.
