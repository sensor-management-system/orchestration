# This script is meant to check the current vm.max_map_count
# setting. It is necessary as elasticsearch may need a higher
# value than the default os setting (even for a proper start).
#
# The script will run and stop in case of a too low setting.
# If the setting is high enough the script just runs and
# returns with a success return value without any text output.
