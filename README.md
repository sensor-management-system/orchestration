## How to run

At first generate self signed certificate you can use the python
script `ngnix/certs/ice-ca-certs.py`. The script requires the python library *zeroc-icecertutils*,
which you can install with `pip install zeroc-icecertutils`. Make sure you execute the script inside
the target folder `nginx/certs`.

In case you have an older pip version you may have to run `pip install --upgrade pip`, so that the build process with rust is supported.

1. copy all files ending with
   ```env.template```. Fill the variables and rename it
   to ```env.dev```

2. Start the containers and run them in background:

```bash
    docker-compose --env-file ./docker/env.dev  up -d
```

You can watch the output of the containers witch `docker-compose logs`:

```bash
docker-compose logs --follow 
```
