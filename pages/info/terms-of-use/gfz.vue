        By using the offered services at <a href="https://sensors.gfz-potsdam.de">sensors.gfz-potsdam.de</a>
        (“Services”) you agree to the following terms of use of Helmholtz Centre Potsdam – GFZ German Research

        I. Service Sensor Management System – what it is about
      </h3>
      <p class="block">
        The Services of the Sensor Management System (“SMS”) encompass the provision of a database
        with data and information on sensors, measurement setups and campaigns run in scientific
        context provided by GFZ and third parties (“Content”).
      </p>
      <p class="block">
        The SMS can be used by individuals without registration as visit to the website
        (“Visitors”, see III.) and by individuals who have registered an account and who also can
        upload Content (“Registered User”, see II.).
      </p>
      <p class="block">
        The Content is only provided for information purposes. If applicable, Registered Users
        can add information where further information on the conditions for renting or borrowing
        a sensor can be found. It is not possible to rent or borrow a sensor via the SMS.
        A commercial use of the SMS is explicitly forbidden.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mb-1">
        II. Provision of Content as Registered User
      </h3>
      <p class="block">
        To be able to add, modify, recreate and store Content to the SMS as “Registered User” ,
        You need a registered account at one of the identity providers registered at Helmholtz
        Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure (“Helmholtz AAI”). In most of the cases
        this account is provided by your user account at your home institution participating at
        Helmholtz AAI.
      </p>
      <p class="block">
        When creating Content, the Registered User must be a member of a virtual organization
        (“Editing Group”) in the Helmholtz AAI.
        See
        <a href="https://hifis.net/doc/helmholtz-aai/howto-vo-management/">
          https://hifis.net/doc/helmholtz-aai/howto-vo-management/
        </a>
        for more information.
      </p>
      <p class="block">
        As Registered User, You grant us an irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide
        and perpetual right to use the Content in and in the context of the SMS. You also agree
        that we and other Registered Users or Visitors of the SMS are entitled to make publicly
        accessible, copy or distribute metadata provided by You under Creative Commons License CCO.
        You and your Organization indemnify and hold us harmless from any costs, damages and other
        losses we suffer as a result of third-party claims stating that the Content infringes such
        third-party rights or is otherwise unlawful.
      </p>
      <p class="block">
        The visibility of the Content can be classified by the Registered User or authorized
        participants of the Editing Group for the specific Content as <i>private</i> (only visible to the
        Registered User who created that specific Content, <i>internal</i> (only visible to Registered Users
        of the SMS) and <i>public</i> (visible to Registered Users and Visitors).
      </p>
      <p class="block">
        When You provide Content, in addition to the above the following applies:
      </p>
      <p class="block">
        <ul>
          <li>You shall use the SMS in accordance with applicable laws and regulations;</li>
          <li>You shall not knowingly place incorrect or otherwise misleading or unlawful Content in the SMS;</li>
          <li>You shall not upload private content;</li>
          <li>
            You shall not upload content that breaches copyright regulations, personality rights,
            or confidentiality undertakings signed in connection with your work;
          </li>
          <li>
            You shall only include links to URLs and third party content that you are legally allowed to
            do so and under observance of copyright issues (i.e. giving copyright attribution); in case you
            receive the information that the third party URL or Content is not lawfully or not with
            legal allowance included in your account, you shall delete it with immediate effect;
          </li>
          <li>
            Neither you, nor anyone on your behalf shall use the SMS in a manner that would require us
            and/or you to obtain an export control license in any country. Such use includes without limitation
            training or use for weapons, whether biological, chemical, nuclear or otherwise and for any
            other military or nuclear devices;
          </li>
          <li>
            You are responsible for all activity occurring under your Account. If you believe your Account
            has been, or can be, accessed by an unauthorized person, you should immediately change your password
            and should notify us immediately by email at <a href="mailto:support@hifis.net">support@hifis.net</a>;
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="block">
        The respective home institution will be notified in the event of any of these conditions being
        breached. The institution will then decide on any legal action that may be necessary in addition
        to legal steps we reserve.

      </p>
      <p class="block">
        <ul>
          <li>limit your request to a single thread;</li>
          <li>request from one machine only, no distributed scripts (for example a cluster or cloud service);</li>
          <li>results must be cached on your side, so clients sending repeatedly the same request may be blocked.</li>
